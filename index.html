                I’m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with
                myself. Sure, I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am
                now: grateful, full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful
                person in future and have a high quality of life.
