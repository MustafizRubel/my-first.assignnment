            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to listen</p>

                <h2>Salad </h2>
                <p>A salad is a dish consisting of mixed pieces of food, typically with at least one raw ingredient. It
                    is often dressed, and is typically served at room temperature or chilled, though some can be served
                    warm. Garden salads use a base of leafy greens such as lettuce, arugula/rocket, kale or spinach;
                    they are common enough that the word salad alone often refers specifically to garden salads.</p>

                <h2>Sesame Pasta </h2>
                <p>A quick side dish with an Asian flair. A change from fried rice. Other vegetables may be used in
                    place of or along with the green onion and bean sprouts, including sliced mushrooms, pea pods,
                    slivered carrots, etc. Any large vegetables should be precooked in a little oil and then added to

                <h2>Vegetable Kottu Roti </h2>
                <p>Vegetarianism is growing rapidly in New Zealand, but other parts of the world have had meat-free
                    cuisines for centuries. For a rich and varied plant-based diet, talk to Chinese, Indians, Mexicans…
                    Our wonderful volunteers have shared authentic recipes from around the world. Most of these recipes
                    were traditionally vegan, but some were meat-based recipes that have been ‘veganised’. We have
                    collected 31 recipes from 31 different countries to share with you – one for each day of October.
